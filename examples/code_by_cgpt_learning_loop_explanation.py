Certainly! The final for loop in the provided code represents the main training loop for the DQN agent. It consists of several episodes, and during each episode, the agent interacts with the custom TradingEnvironment to learn the best actions to maximize total profit. Here's the breakdown of the main training loop:

Iterate through the episodes:
python
Copy code
for e in range(num_episodes):
The number of episodes for training is specified by num_episodes.

Reset the environment and reshape the initial state:
python
Copy code
state = env.reset()
state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size[0], state_size[1]])
At the beginning of each episode, the environment is reset to its initial state, and the state is reshaped to match the input shape expected by the Q-Network.

Initialize the total profit for the current episode:
python
Copy code
total_profit = 0
Iterate through the steps in each episode:
python
Copy code
for _ in range(env.max_steps):
The maximum number of steps in an episode is defined by the environment's max_steps.

Select an action based on the current state:
python
Copy code
action = agent.act(state)
The agent selects an action using its epsilon-greedy policy based on the current state.

Perform the selected action in the environment:
python
Copy code
next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
The environment processes the selected action, resulting in a new state, reward, and a done flag indicating if the episode has ended.

Reshape the next state and store the experience in the agent's memory:
python
Copy code
next_state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size[0], state_size[1]])
agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
Update the current state and accumulate the reward as total profit:
python
Copy code
state = next_state
total_profit += reward
Check if the episode has ended:
python
Copy code
if done:
    print(f"Episode: {e + 1}/{num_episodes}, Total Profit: {total_profit}")
    break
If the episode has ended (done is True), print the total profit for the current episode and move on to the next episode.

Train the agent using experience replay if there are enough experiences in memory:
python
Copy code
if len(agent.memory) > batch_size:
    agent.replay(batch_size)
If the agent's memory has more experiences than the specified batch_size, the agent is trained using a random minibatch of experiences.

Update the target Q-Network periodically:
python
Copy code
if (e + 1) % 10 == 0:
    agent.update_target_model()
After every 10 episodes, the weights of the
